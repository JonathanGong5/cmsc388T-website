Github Pages Link: https://jonathangong5.github.io/cmsc388T-website/
- I added a link to my instagram page as my custom change.

Terpconnect Link: https://terpconnect.umd.edu/jgong123/cmsc388T-website/
- At the time of submission, my website was not visible on terpconnect. I assume this was for the same reason as referenced in the announcement on Slack.
